                <h1>Exchange programme - USA</h1>
                <h2>15/08/2021 - 15/12/2021</h2>
                <p>During my fifth semester at HOWEST I decided to take part in the Exchange programme.
                    I wanted to go to the USA as it houses the largest tech companies in the world and would be a great
                    addition to my CV.
                    <br><br>
                    I got appointed to Northwest Missouri State University or NWMSU, and was allowed to travel with
                    current COVID travel restrictions.
                    The programme started on the 15th of August, with the start of the semester a week later.
                    I took up the courses:<br>
                    'Data Structures',<br>
                    'Secure Programming',<br>
                    'Mobile Computing-iOS',<br>
                    'Developing Web Applications and Services',<br>
                    and lastly as mandatory general course 'The United States to 1877'.
                    <br><br>
                    Most courses didn't feature any new content for me as I had seen most of it in my first 2 years at
                    Howest, with the exception of the datastructures. This courses went very in-depth into the workings
                    of several Datastructures, and how they are implemented in Java.
                    <br><br>
                    I feel like I didn't learn a lot school-wise, I did however learn a lot in terms of social and
                    cultural aspects because of the diversity in the student body.
                    <br><br>
                    I would recommend an international exchange experience to any of the students that come after me at
                    Howest. Even tho it might be difficult to keep up with your year-long courses at home, the
                    experience of going abroad is definitely worth it.

                <h1>Cybersecurity Challenge - Year 2</h1>
                <h2>09/03/2021 - 10/03/2021</h2>
                <p>This is my second time participating in Belgium's Cybersecurity Challenge.
                    Due to covid, this year's edition was planned to be completely online & remote.
                    The first 60 teams would qualify for the next round, unlike the 43 from last year.
                    <br><br>
                    This year I formed a team with my fellow 2nd year students, under which were Shayne Declercq, Randy
                    Bosmans, and Alexander Dekker.
                    With last year's knowledge under my belt I was able to solve a good few challenges very quickly.
                    The more difficult challenges weren't solved as quickly, largely due to my lack of expert knowledge
                    in system penetration and hacking.
                    Fortunately my fellow students were in the Cybersecurity Bachelor and could help out.
                    <br><br>
                    This year's challenges were notably harder than last year's, and we ended up on a shared 71st place.
                    Right under the qualification line.
                    This year wasn't as much of a learning experience as last year, it was however more fun and
                    entertaining because I was able to solve some challenges myself.

                <h1>Cybersecurity Challenge</h1>
                <h2>10/03/2020 - 11/03/2020</h2>
                <p>The Cybersecurity Challenge is a yearly CTF-event hosted in Belgium by several educational
                    institutions and the countries defence departement.
                    During the challenge teams face each other and the clock whilst they find flags in various
                    challenges and try to get as many points as possible.
                    The teams have 32 hours during which they solve various challenges related to cybersecurity.
                    This year only the top 43 teams make the cut to move on to the pre-finals.
                    <br><br>
                    My team consisted of me and several 2nd year Howest Cybersecurity Specialist students such as
                    Rafael De Smet en Sandro Deblonde.
                    Unfortunately our team placed 51st and was not able to qualify for the next round.
                    <br><br>
                    As this was my first CTF-event, I had no experience with things like steganography and pentesting.
                    Throughout this event I couldn't really contribute to my team's progress due to my lack of
                    experience.
                    I was however able to learn a lot during this experience and I would like to try again next year.
